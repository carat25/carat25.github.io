          Hello! My name is Cara and I am a Software QA Analyst/ Engineer turned
          Software Developer. I have recently completed a 12-weeks Software
          Development course in{" "}
          <span className={styles.aboutme__par_bold}>_nology.io</span>. My
          interest in software development started when I was at the peek of my
          Software QA career. I have always relied on developers to create test
          data, fixed test environments and change configurations in the
          application I was testing and I thought it looks exciting and figured
          if they can do it, so can I. And here I am.
        </p>
        <p className={styles.aboutme__par}>
          Other than coding/ testing, I also enjoy travelling and baking is my
          therapy!
        </p>
        <p className={styles.aboutme__par}>
          Here's the list of technologies that I have learned and used during
          the course:

        <img
          src={myPhoto}
